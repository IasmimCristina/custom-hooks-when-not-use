## Application

1. It's a cats list app with an option of adding new cats saved in local storage. There's also a toggle for dark and light mode.
2. This repository envisions to show how to deal with unwished and problematic re-renders in a React application. Those tips should not be used always since memoization might also harm your app. Use it wisely and read the blog post for more information.
